Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis is a valuable tool for businesses to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of their customer acquisition efforts. 
It helps make informed decisions about resource allocation and marketing strategies, ultimately contributing to the company’s growth and profitability.
The process of Customer Acquisition Cost starts with collecting data on customer acquisition cost expenses.
Let's take a look at the CAC by marketing channels:

So, the customer acquisition cost of Email marketing is the highest and social media is the lowest. 
Now, let’s have a look at the relationship between new customers acquired and CAC

So, the negative slope of the trendline in the above graph suggests that there is a tendency for channels with a higher number of new customers to have a lower CAC. 
In other words, as marketing efforts become more effective in acquiring customers, the cost per customer tends to decrease.

 Finding insights into the conversion rate by marketing channel:
  Calculated conversion rate by data['Conversion_Rate'] = data['New_Customers'] / data['Marketing_Spend'] * 100

So, we can see that the conversion rates of online ads are better than all other channels.

Now, let’s calculate the break-even customers for this marketing campaign. Break-even customers refer to the number of new customers that a company needs to 
acquire through a specific marketing channel to cover the costs associated with that marketing channel.
When the actual number of new customers acquired through the channel exceeds the break-even number, it indicates that the marketing efforts
are generating more revenue than the costs, resulting in a profit.

Here’s how to find break-even customers for each marketing channel:
data['Break_Even_Customers'] = data['Marketing_Spend'] / data['CAC']

Now, let’s compare the actual customers acquired with the break-even customers for each marketing channel:

So, this shows a positive result of the marketing campaign as the actual customers acquired from all marketing channels exactly match the break-even customers.
If the actual customers acquired were short of the break-even point, it would have indicated a need to reassess marketing strategies or 
allocate additional resources to those channels.
